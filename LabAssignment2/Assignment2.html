<h3 style="color:#AFA876">Importance of Energy Conservation</h3>
<p style="color:#728C00"><b>Saving energy, increasing efficiency and conservation are all terms used to describe ways we can reduce
our overall energy consumption.</p>
<p style="color:#728C00">Energy conservation refers to reducing energy consumption through using less of an energy service.
Energy conservation differs from efficient energy use, which refers to using less energy for a constant service.
<br>For example, driving less is an example of energy conservation. Driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle
is an example of energy efficiency.
<br>Energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques.
Even though energy conservation reduces energy services, it can result in increased environmental quality, national security,
personal financial security and higher savings. It is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy.
<br>It also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource depletion. Now the question is why is it important to conserve energy?
<p style="color:#728C00">
There are several reasons for why we would do this in our houses, but it can be summarized to two main reasons:</p>
<ol style="color:#E55451">
<li>To save money by reducing our electrical bill.</li>
<li>To lower the stress we put on the environment by using less energy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="color:#AFA876">Importance in Today's World</h3>
<p style="color:#728C00">The climate change is rapidly getting <i><b>worse</b></i> and we need to reduce
energy consumption even on an individual level. In fact, if everyone starts saving energy at home,
we are already on a good way to getting emission levels down to normal. Also, it will help in reduction
of fossil fuel consumption and will help protect our environment from degradation.
</p>
<p style="color:#728C00">Since, our environment is fast degrading, we need to take steps to protect it. Fossil fuels are not going to last forever.
Also, we have to stop adding pollutants to our environment.</p>
